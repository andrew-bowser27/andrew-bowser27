                    This is only a test! LOL so I guess that is pretty lucky! Nothing to purchase, nothing to lose but a little bit of time!<br>
                    If you are however lucky to make it to this site before I remove it, then that is pretty lucky because you are seeing only a basic example<br>
                    of what I am going to be accomplishing soon! These examplese <strong><em>WILL</em></strong> only get better!<br>
                    I have been learning web development from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/The_head_metadata_in_HTML" title="Mozilla Developer Network">Firefox's tutorial</a>
                    and I <strong><em>strongly</em></strong> recommend you learn too!
